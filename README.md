I’m @JATothrim, an bit obscure C/C++ dev that does stuff just because I want to.
Being self taught, I know what I can do and what I don't understand.

Few major software projects that I have accumulated over the years:
 - KiloEngine, on going C++/OpenGL based SDK for writing graphics and game code. (not public yet)
 - Linux kernel development: Clang -fprofile-generate patches (public, go see)
 - Toy Lemppel-Ziv styled data compressor. (not public)

Addition to Arch Linux, btw. I do sometimes bit of µC and bare electronic circuit stuff.

Craziest thing I have constructed is an ~24W Tesla coil run from 12V PSU.
It lights up fluorescent bulbs from 20cm away. Woot.
